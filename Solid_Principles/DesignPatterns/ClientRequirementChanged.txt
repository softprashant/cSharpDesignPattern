The client wanted to only build Name but now he wants to setup the position

so there is a need to have the personPositionBuilder , but we would still seek  builder
pattern to a fluent API.

One could think of having another class that inherits the PersonNameBuilder  - 

See the issue in folder - APIShippedDay5


What I have acheived - 

I can keep on building the buidler using recursive generics builder pattern

and I will just change the line - 

Builder : PersonPositionBuilder<Builder>

in person.cs

to 

Builder : Person(((new builder))))Builder<Builder>
