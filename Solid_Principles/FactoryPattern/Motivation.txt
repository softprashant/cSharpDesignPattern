Motivation to have the factory pattern is that 
we want ot use the cocept of seperation of concern
For smaller classes it ois ok to have constructor creating to
objects but somehow for larger classes is advisable to delegate this
responsibility to A seperate class

compare the Factory Method Point class with the Point class

Drawback of the Factory pattern is that now you have to make constructor public (point)
