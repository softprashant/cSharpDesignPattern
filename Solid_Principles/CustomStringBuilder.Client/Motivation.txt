The decorator pattern is used to add more funcationlity to a class
in a way that you will not write the code in the same class although 
it is fine because you are satifiying the OCP but it may break the SRP

Also there may be a case where you have the class coming from API which is 
sealed hence ineritence is not an option.

So by defnition - 

Adapter pattern the pattern which is used to enhanve the current class 
functionality without inhertence or writing the code inside the class

-- In this project we will build Custom String Builder - Need to do it is taht
   beacuse the StringBuider is a sealed class
