Why factory method -

You want to create  object  in a way that - You want to create more then two way with the same parameters 

When I say creational it is always relate to constructor

So , 

Point(double a , double b)

Point(double cos ,double sin) [Not possible]


So Factory Method comes into rescue 

See code
